# Actions that can be taken

When we review a project, we won't just talk the talk. We will contribute some improvements that we find can be done. Hopefully authors will accept our pull requests :blush:

Here are some of the actions that can be taken to improve a project under review.

## Refactor

If there are better / more readable ways to write a piece of code, we can do that.

## Make code consistent (eslint)

If the code doesn't follow a style guide, we can improve it so it does.

## Tests

If there are no or little tests, we can write some.

## Documentation

If the docs aren't up to date, or not good enough or missing stuff, we can write docs and fix that.

## Examples

If examples / demos are missing, we can create some.

## GH Page

If there is no showcase web page for the project, or it's lacking in some way, we can make it better.
