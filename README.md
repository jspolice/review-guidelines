### JS Police

At JS Police, we're trying to help the JavaScript Open Source community by reviewing projects against these guidelines, and contributing fixes. :raised_hands:


Our hope is to spread awareness about code quality in Open Source projects, and to create a consistent system for achieving professional quality. :sparkles:

This should have several positive consequences:

1. Open Source projects will have better quality
2. It will lower the barrier for contributing to Open Source projects
3. We will learn about code quality
4. We'll review cool JS libraries on our [blog](http://jspolice.com)
